Everything interesting and worthwhile about this repo is not in the code.
Rather, look at these things:

- My [`homebrew-tap`][tap-repo] Github repository, in particular the
  [`Formula/hello-homebrew-packaging`][formula] file.

- My Bintray repository:
  [`bintray.com/easoncxz/homebrew-bottles`][bintray-repo]

- The Continuous Integration configuration of this repo:
    - Travis CI as per [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml)
    - Github Actions as per
      [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml)

- An automation tool I created: [`easoncxz/homebrew_automation`][auto]. This
  tool is being used from shell scripts in the [`automation/`](automation/)
  directory of this repo.

For a guided tour of the Mac Homebrew package publishing workflows, please head
over to the [Wiki][wiki], where I show you in detail how this repo is set up
from scratch, and in particular, my process of figuring things out.
