A program to demonstrate Homebrew packaging
===========================================

Everything interesting and worthwhile about this repo is not in the code.

Rather, please look at the [Wiki][wiki] (which I've spent a lot of time writing!), or look at the CI configurations (for both Travis CI and Github Actions). This demo project accompanies the automation tool I created at the [`easoncxz/homebrew_automation`][auto] repo.
